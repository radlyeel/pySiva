# PySiva

## Description
For a solid introduction to Digital Image Processing, see
live.ece.utexas.edu/class/siva/default.htm.  Clicking the "SIVA DIP" tab takes
you to live.ece.utexas.edu/class/siva/siva_dip.htm, the demo gllery, a rich
suite of "live" demos.  Thse demos are written as Labview VIs, which is a
problem for those without Labview and/or the Labview moduleIMAQ.  Compiled
Windows executables are available, but for MacOS and Linux users there seems to
be no access.   

Yhe intent of PySiva is to bridge that gap by implementing selected demos in Python with OpenCV anf Tkinter.


## Environment.
At the outset, the development environments consisted of
MacOS 13.7.3,  Python 3.12.2, OpenCV 4.0.0
