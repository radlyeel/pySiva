# PySiva

## Description
For a solid introduction to Digital Image Prceossing, see
live.ece.utexas.edu/class/siva/default.htm.  Clicking the "SIVA DIP" tab takes
you to live.ece.utexas.edu/class/siva/siva_dip.htm, the demo gllery, a rich suite of "live" demos.  Thse demos are written as Labview "VI"s, which is a problem for thoe without Labiew and/or IMAQ.  Compiled Windows executables, but for MacOS and Linux users, there seems to be no access.

Yhe intent of PySiva is to bridge that gap by implementing selected demos in Python with OpenCV anf Tkinter.


## Environment.
At the outset, the development environments consisted of
MacOS 13.7.3,  Python 3.12.2, OpenCV 4.0.0
